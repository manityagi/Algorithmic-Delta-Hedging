# Algorithmic-Delta-Hedging
Established and maintained an effective risk-free portfolio of Europian options by using Black Scholes model to calculate the delta every tick
and rapidly rehedging on the basis of that delta, assuming no transaction cost. The underlying asset was modelled using Geometric Brownian Motion and the derivative pricing is done using binomial trees.
